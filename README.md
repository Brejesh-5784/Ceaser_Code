Here’s a sample **README.md** file for your `caesar_decode` function:

---

# Caesar Cipher Decoder

This project contains a Python script to decode messages encrypted using the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. This script attempts all 26 possible shifts to identify the original plaintext.

---

## Features

- **Brute-Force Decoding**: Automatically tries all 26 possible shifts of the Caesar cipher.
- **Case-Insensitive**: Converts all input text to uppercase for consistent decoding.
- **Non-Alphabetic Characters**: Preserves spaces, punctuation, and other non-alphabetic characters in the output.
- **Readable Output**: Prints the decoded message for each shift, allowing the user to identify the correct plaintext easily.

---

## Usage

### Prerequisites
You need Python installed on your system. This script is compatible with Python 3.x.

### Example Input
The Caesar cipher decoder accepts any encrypted message (ciphertext). Here's an example:

Ciphertext:  
```
WKLV LV D WHVW PHVVDJH
```

### Example Output
When the script is run, it prints all 26 possible decoded messages, one for each shift:

```
Shift 0: WKLV LV D WHVW PHVVDJH
Shift 1: VJKU KU C VGUV OGUUCIG
Shift 2: UIJT JT B UFUT NFTTBHF
Shift 3: THIS IS A TEST MESSAGE
Shift 4: SGHR HR Z SDRS LDSSZFD
Shift 5: RFHQ GQ Y RCQR KCRRYEC
...
```

In this case, **Shift 3** produces the correct plaintext:  
`THIS IS A TEST MESSAGE`.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository or copy the script**  
   Copy the Python script containing the `caesar_decode` function.

2. **Modify the ciphertext**  
   Replace the example ciphertext with your own encoded message in the script.

3. **Run the script**  
   Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python caesar_decode.py
   ```

4. **Analyze the output**  
   Check the decoded outputs for all shifts and identify the correct plaintext.

## Script Details

The core function in the script is:

### `caesar_decode(ciphertext)`
This function takes an encrypted Caesar cipher text as input and prints all possible decoded messages for shifts 0 through 25.

#### Parameters
- `ciphertext` (*str*): The encrypted message.

#### Example Call
```python
caesar_decode("WKLV LV D WHVW PHVVDJH")
```

#### Output
The decoded message for each shift is printed in the format:  
`Shift <shift>: <decoded_message>`.

---

## Limitations

- The script only supports the English alphabet (A-Z).
- The correct plaintext must be manually identified from the output.
- Does not automatically determine the most likely plaintext using language analysis (future enhancement).

---

## Applications

- Decoding messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher.
- Learning and teaching substitution cipher mechanics.
- Demonstrating the insecurity of Caesar cipher encryption.
